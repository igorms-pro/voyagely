**Status:** Strategic Positioning – Early Product Phase (Free)

## The Golden Circle

### WHY - Our Belief

**We believe that group travel planning should be collaborative, not chaotic.**

Planning trips with friends, family, or colleagues shouldn't mean endless WhatsApp threads, broken Google Sheets, and decisions that never get made. Every group deserves a simple way to plan together—one that respects everyone's preferences and makes decisions transparent and shared.

### HOW - Our Approach

**We build the only platform designed for constraint-based, group decision-making in travel.**

Unlike solo trip planners or booking platforms, Voyagely is built from the ground up for groups:

- **Constraint-aware trip planning**: budget, children, preferences, pace, "must-dos" (whale watching, nightlife, nature, etc.)
- **Real-time collaboration**: presence, chat, simultaneous editing
- **Democratic decision-making**: votes on complete day-by-day itineraries _and_ on each individual activity
- **Group-aware AI**: AI proposes scenarios for _the group_, not just for one individual

### WHAT - Our Product

**Voyagely is the Group Decision & Planning Platform for Travel.**

Voyagely helps groups go from "we don't know what to do" to a concrete plan in minutes:

- **AI-powered, constraint-based itineraries**: AI generates multiple day-by-day plans based on group constraints (budget, children, interests, pace)
- **Structured voting on days and activities**: members can vote for a complete itinerary (Day 1 / Day 2) or accept/reject/modify each activity
- **Live collaboration with presence and chat**: everyone sees who's online, discusses, and adjusts the plan in real-time
- **Context-aware suggestions**: weather, opening hours, travel time, and fatigue logic integrated into planning
- **Built-in group expenses (Tricount-like)**: track group expenses, "who owes what to whom", simple exports

## Value Proposition

### For Groups Who Can't Decide

**"Stop the group chat chaos. Plan your voyage together."**

Instead of scattering across WhatsApp, Excel, random links, and separate expense apps, groups get:

- **From indecision to itinerary in minutes**: AI proposes 2-3 realistic scenarios, the group votes, the plan is decided
- **Everyone's voice matters**: votes on day-by-day itineraries and on each activity, with the ability to mark activities as "must-have" or "no-go"
- **Real-time coordination**: real-time presence, integrated chat, clear notifications when the plan changes
- **Smart, realistic planning**: weather, travel time, opening hours, pace, and constraints (children, budget) are all taken into account
- **Integrated group expenses**: like Tricount, but directly linked to the trip, so finances never become a source of friction

### Our Unique Position

**We're NOT:**

- ❌ A booking platform (we plan, others book)
- ❌ A solo trip planner (we're group-first)
- ❌ Just another AI tool (AI is the engine, **group collaboration is the product**)
- ❌ A social network (we're here to get trips planned and done)

**We ARE:**

- ✅ **The** platform for groups planning complex trips together
- ✅ **The** solution for group decision-making under real constraints (budget, children, preferences)
- ✅ **The** real-time collaboration and expense layer for travel planning
- ✅ **The** AI that understands group dynamics, not just one person's desires

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem

The travel and planning app market is growing rapidly but remains largely focused on individuals, while a significant portion of travel happens in groups. Many tools focus on booking or static itineraries without seriously addressing **group decision-making** and **coordination**.

**Current reality:**

- A large portion of trips are group trips (friends, families, colleagues), but planning remains fragmented across messaging apps, shared documents, and separate expense apps
- Existing planners mostly address a single "trip owner" who organizes for everyone, rarely a democratic decision-making process

### The Opportunity

Voyagely addresses a space that's still largely unoccupied: the **decision + planning + group finances layer**.

- Clear pain point: indecision, coordination, mental fatigue of the organizer
- Clear gap: few or no solutions that combine AI, group constraints, voting, and expenses in one flow
- Network effects: each trip naturally brings multiple new users

---

## Target Users

### Primary Segments

1. **Friend Groups** (Bachelor/bachelorette parties, reunions, group vacations)
   - Pain: Too many opinions, no one makes the final call
   - Need: A tool that proposes scenarios and decides through voting

2. **Families** (Multi-generational, with children)
   - Pain: Multiple constraints (children, budget, fatigue, safety)
   - Need: A realistic, kid-friendly plan that respects everyone's pace

3. **Couples** (Important trips, anniversaries, honeymoons)
   - Pain: Compromise, mental overload of one partner
   - Need: Express each person's desires and get a plan that balances both

4. **Corporate Teams** (Offsites, retreats, team travel)
   - Pain: Budget approval, limited time, many constraints
   - Need: Quick scenarios, cost visibility, simple coordination

---

## Competitive Advantage

### Our Defensible Moats

1. **Constraint-based Group Planning Engine**
   - AI explicitly encodes: budget, group size, presence of children, pace, must-dos, time and travel constraints
   - Produces "livable" itineraries, not just lists of ideas

2. **Group Decision-Making System**
   - Voting on scenarios (Day 1 vs Day 2) and on each activity
   - Mechanisms to handle conflicts ("if we want whale watching, we need to remove X or increase budget by Y")

3. **Real-Time Collaboration + Expenses**
   - Chat, presence, real-time editing on the itinerary
   - Integrated Tricount-like: expenses are no longer a separate tool, but part of the trip

4. **Speed + Focus**
   - Unique focus on **group travel** and its constraints, where big players are scattered and booking-oriented

## Business Model

### Current Phase: Free Product to Validate Usage

**Voyagely is currently free.**

**Objectives of this phase:**

- Validate usage intensity (number of trips, number of active members, engagement on votes and planning)
- Test acceptance and perceived value of advanced features (enhanced AI, exports, integrations)
- Understand which features could justify payment later, without restricting the core experience

**Future paths (to be decided later, after real usage):**

- **Generous freemium** (core planning + expenses free, advanced AI / exports / integrations in Pro)
- **One-time per trip** for certain cases (important trips)
- **Complementary revenue**: booking commissions, financial partnerships, B2B offers for teams

---

## Success Metrics

### Product-Market Fit Indicators

- **Collaboration rate:** >70% of trip members actively participate (votes, comments, modifications)
- **Voting engagement:** >80% of proposed activities receive votes
- **AI scenario acceptance:** >60% of groups adopt one of the AI itineraries as a base
- **Viral coefficient:** >1.0 (each trip brings on average more than one new group)

### Business Health (Post-Free)

To be measured once a paid model is introduced: conversion to paid, churn, CAC/LTV

---

## Current Status & Next Steps

### ✅ Completed / Underway

- Modern technical foundation (React, TypeScript, Supabase, realtime, tests, monitoring)
- Basic flows: trip creation, members, activities, AI itinerary, initial voting, chat

### 🎯 Next Steps

- Complete MVP of the constraint engine (budget, children, preferences, pace)
- MVP of integrated group expense system
- Voting loops: day-by-day scenarios + votes per activity, with simple UI
- "100% free" phase to observe usage and refine the business model

---

## Conclusion

Voyagely is positioned to own the "Group Decision & Planning Platform for Travel" category. By focusing on constraint-based group collaboration, voting on AI proposals, and integrated expenses, we address a real, underserved problem that existing players ignore.

**Our advantage:** Constraint-aware planning engine, group decision-making system, and integrated collaboration + expenses.

**Our opportunity:** Underserved group travel planning market with clear pain points and no dominant player.

**Our mission:** Make group travel planning collaborative, not chaotic—from indecision to itinerary in minutes.

**Our approach:** Start free, validate usage, then refine the business model based on real user behavior.
